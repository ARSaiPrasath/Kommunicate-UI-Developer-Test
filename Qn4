Question 4: Describe the best project you have worked on, including links if any.

The best project I have worked on is a dynamic web application which is “Finance” in which we can manage portfolio of stocks. 
This allows us to check real stocks' actual prices and portfolios' values. 
It will also let us buy and sell stocks by querying IEX for stocks' prices. 
And we can view the transaction history of the user of how much stocks they have bought or sold and view their current balance. 
This project was associated with a course called CS50x. I have implemented this project using Flask. I created a database of users and managed the database with phpLiteAdmin. 
I created the front-end using HTML and CSS and deployed it on a Flask Server. This app takes an API call from IEX Cloud where I can take the API tokens and paste it in my server, thus collecting real time stocks prices. 
While doing this project I learnt everything about Flask and how API works and how to integrate backend server with front-end.
